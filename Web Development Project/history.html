	 			<p>Apple was founded in the 1970’s by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. They built the Apple I in Steve Job’s garage and this was the beginning of the multibillion dollar company that has changed the world.</p>

	 			<p>The Apple I was sold to byte for an order of 50 units at $500 each, the money made from this was then put towards building the apple II which was a much better computer. Apple officially formed on April 1st 1976 after receiving a bank loan for $250,000 and a generous investment from Mr Markkula. The release of the Apple II was a huge success selling over 6 million units. But this success didn’t last Apple experienced a decline in sales with many failed Products such as the overpriced LISA.</p>

	 			<p>In 1985 Steve Jobs was dismissed from Apple but this wasn’t the end of Jobs. There was very little success with the absence of Steve Job’s. During the 1990’s Apple and it competition was cleaned out by IBM. One of the factors for this was the terrible Management of Apple as a business. Apple started losing business fast. It wasn’t until their purchases of NeXT technology’s when they started to see a turnaround in business. This purchases put Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple this completely changed Apple into the company we now know today.</p>

	 			<p>There were several steps in this process one was a bailout from Microsoft allowing them to have Microsoft office on the Mac and a $150 million investment. This was the start of Apple dominance in the computer industry.</p>

	 			<p>In 2001 Apple revolutionised the world with the release of the iPod this completely changed the music industry and sparked the development of many products with in Apple. From here on Apple began the I era creating many products we use today such as the iPhone, iPad, iOS etc. This era has helped Apple reach the top.</p>

	 			<p>Apple Computer 1, also known later as the Apple I, or Apple-1, is a desktop computer released by the Apple Computer Company (now Apple Inc.) in 1976. It was designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak. Wozniak's friend Steve Jobs had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Microbus, for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500; however, Wozniak said that Jobs planned to use his bicycle if necessary. It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California.</p>
				<p>Production was discontinued on September 30, 1977, after the June 10, 1977, introduction of its successor, the Apple II, which Byte magazine referred to as part of the "1977 Trinity" of personal computing (along with the PET 2001 and the TRS-80).</p>
