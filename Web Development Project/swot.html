         <h2>STRENGTHS</h2>
           <h3 class="swot">Strong Brand Image</h3>
            <p>Apple has the best brand image in the US and is the most valuable brand with the value of USD 124.4 billion. Forbes (2014). Apple is the most popular brand in the business currently claiming the top spot from google in 2011. Forbs (2011). What makes apple so successful is there portfolio that covers multiple industry’s. Cam-jones, B (2012).</p>
            <h3 class="swot">High Profit Margins</h3> 
             <p>Apple constantly has large profit margin in comparison to the industry average.  These large profit margins give Apple the ability to continue their operations during economic recessions and allows them to invest massively into R&D. Industry analysts note that “Apple isn’t here to sell the most of anything; its overarching goal is simply to generate the greatest possible profit”. Savov, V. (2016).</p>
            <h3 class="swot">Financial Strengths</h3>
             <p>With earnings of over USD 182.7 billion and a net income of over UDS 39.5 billion from 2014 alone. This sets a strong foundation for apple to be able to invest heavily in research and development giving them a competitive advantage of innovation and design. Annual Report (2014)</p>
          <h2>WEAKNESSES</h2>
              <h3 class="swot">High Product Prices</h3>
               <p>Apples products a notorious for being over priced in comparison to competitors. For example, a 128GB iPhone 6 costs $849 comp aired to the Samsung Galaxy S5 128GB microSD which is only $670 this is the direct competitor to the iPhone 6 but it is $280 cheaper. Kypreos, E. (2015).</p>
              <h3>Incompatibility of Apple Products</h3>
               <p>The main disadvantage of Apple products is there incompatibility with third-party software. The famous Apple universe is an example of this as you must continue with apple only products and services. This impacts consumer’s decision making hugely.</p>
              <h3 class="swot">Lack of Innovation</h3>
               <p>The past few years Apple has been spending less and less on R&D and this has led to less unique products being introduced to the market. Although innovation is what made apple the billion-dollar company it is today the company isn’t succeeding in making any truly inspiration products.</p>
            <h2>OPPORTUNITIES</h2>
               <h3 class="swot">Technological Advancements</h3>
                 <p>Technological advancements are always an opportunity. And Apple will always make the best of this new technology. We can always expect more advanced products such as macs and iPhones to be released and even more diverse products such as the apple watch and even the apple car.</p>
                <h3 class="swot">The Growing market</h3>
                 <p>Apple is in a growing market. The increase in GDP of developing countries is causing a rise in the consumption of premium products like the Apple iPhone and other Apple products. An example of this is the emerging market in Africa. There is a predicted boom in Africa’s middle class population from 15million to over 40 million by 2030 and this is a huge new market for Apple to expand into. Pezzini, M (2012). There is also a huge market for Apple to expand into China.</p>
                <h3 class="swot">Product diversification</h3>
                 <p>With Apples range of diverse products such as the Apple iWatch, Apple TV and the Apple car which is set to be released in 2020. All of these products which are aimed at the future and they also allow Apple to expand in to more industry’s.  The Apple IWatch has already 50% of the market shares for smartwatches in the US. Perez, S (2016).</p>
                <h2>THREATS</h2>
                  <h3 class="swot">Aggressive competition</h3>
                   <p>There is a lot of aggressive competition that apple has to face. One of the main areas is in the laptop department which is ever increases with such massive company’s like Dell, Lenovo and Sony being able to produce some pretty challenging laptops compared to Macs. An example is Dell and the Alien ware range. Although the Macs are loved by many they are facing some aggressive competition from competitors. Apple also has aggressive competition with Samsung with their large range of mobile phone which come in all shapes and sizes. Samsung has really shown what can be truly done with the android OS system and this is posing the biggest competition for the Apple iPhone to date.</p>
                  <h3 class="swot">Dependency on Network Providers</h3>
                    <p>The Apple iPhones are heavily dependent on the network providers they rely on only a few cellular network carriers for the distribution and services for the iPhones. Apple are majorly dependant on company’s such as AT&T, O2, T-Mobile and Orange to distribute the iPhone. The cellular network made up for 71% towards the company’s total trade in 2015. If these network carriers cannot attract and maintain iPhone customers or the cancelation any agreements could be a major loss for Apple. Apple, Inc. (2015).</p>
                  <h3 class="swot">Increase on Manufacturing Costs</h3>
                    <p>An increase on manufacturing cost impacts the prices of apple products or reduces the profit made by apple. An increase in the price of the products will have an effect on consumers as where are very conscious on spending money the past few years due to the economic recession.  The past few years the manufacturing cost has risen 3 times from 2010 to 2012 which has caused the products prices to increases to cover this.</p>
